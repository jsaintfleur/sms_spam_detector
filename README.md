## Overview
This project is designed to **detect spam messages** using a machine learning model. By leveraging **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** and **TF-IDF vectorization**, we trained a model to classify SMS messages as either **spam or not spam (ham)**.

We further improved this solution by integrating it into a **Gradio-powered web application**, making it easy for users to classify messages in real-time.

## Why This Matters: Business Applications üìä
Spam detection is a crucial problem in modern communication systems. Businesses and individuals benefit in several ways:

| **Business Sector** | **Use Case** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| üì© **Email Providers** | Automatically filtering spam emails to improve inbox experience. |
| üì± **Telecom Companies** | Blocking fraudulent SMS messages to protect users. |
| üè¶ **Banking & Finance** | Identifying phishing scams sent via SMS. |
| üõçÔ∏è **E-commerce** | Preventing spam promotions from affecting customer engagement. |
| üè• **Healthcare** | Filtering spam messages in patient communications. |

## Features
- **Spam Detection:** Classifies messages as spam or ham.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses **Support Vector Classification (SVC)**.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Converts SMS text into numerical features with **TF-IDF vectorization**.

## Project Implementation üí°

This project is structured into three core components, each serving a specific function in developing an effective SMS spam classification system.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ SMS Classification Model**
The SMS classification model is responsible for training a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between spam and ham messages.

üìå **Key Steps:**
- **Dataset Loading & Exploration:**  
  - Reads `SMSSpamCollection.csv`, a labeled dataset of SMS messages.
  - Checks for missing values and analyzes class distribution (`spam` vs. `ham`).

- **Text Preprocessing:**  
  - Converts text to lowercase.
  - Removes special characters and stopwords (if applicable).
  - Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into numerical features.

- **Model Selection & Training:**  
  - Uses a **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, known for high accuracy in text classification.
  - Hyperparameters are set to ensure optimal performance.
  - The model is trained on a split dataset (e.g., 67% train, 33% test).

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Computes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.
  - Generates a classification report for detailed analysis.

- **Model Persistence:**  
  - Saves the trained model using **Joblib** to allow reuse without retraining.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ SMS Prediction Function**
This function is responsible for classifying new SMS messages using the trained model.

üìå **How It Works:**
- **Receives User Input:**  
  - The function takes an SMS message as input.

- **Text Transformation:**  
  - Applies the **same TF-IDF vectorization** process used during training.

- **Prediction Using SVC Model:**  
  - Passes the processed text through the trained **Linear SVC** model.
  - Predicts whether the message is **spam or ham**.

- **Returns Classification Result:**  
  - Outputs `"spam"` or `"not spam"`, which can be displayed in the terminal or UI.

Example:
```python
predict_sms("Congratulations! You‚Äôve won a free iPhone. Claim now!")  # Output: "spam"
predict_sms("Hey, are we still meeting at 6 PM?")  # Output: "not spam"
```
### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Gradio Web Application**

To make the model accessible to non-technical users, an interactive Gradio-based web app is implemented.

üìå Features of the Gradio Web App:

User-Friendly Interface:

Allows users to enter an SMS message in a text box.
Provides instant classification feedback.
Backend Model Integration:

Loads the trained SVC model (sms_spam_classifier.pkl).
Applies text preprocessing before classification.
Real-Time Predictions:

Uses the trained model to predict spam vs. ham messages in real time.
Deployment Ready:

The Gradio app can be hosted locally or deployed to Hugging Face Spaces, Google Colab, or AWS.
